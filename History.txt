=== 0.0.1 2011-08-22

* First revision working with RedShoes
  * Asks continuously questions
  * For adding words to the dictionary it is necessary to use quizzer
  * For running the graphic quizzer run bin/quizzer_red.bat

  * NO statistics
  
TODO List (possible features to add in the future):
* Add statistics on longest quiz without mistakes
* Add pointing system (every right question gives 10 points, every wrong answer takes out a certain amount)
* Take very known words out of the quiz
  * The one that reaches a score of 100 stop quizzing for one week? Or an amount of sessions?
  * The ones with raw_score over 2 stop appearing at answers and reduce probability at questions?
